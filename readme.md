# approximate bayesian computation struggles
## simulated annealing approach: 
based off of https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2018.0129
uses simulated annealing to infer parameters for the start of the contagion; 
doesn't do super great but it works! it runs!
seen in misinfo_simulation.py
## approximate bayesian computation approach: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.2157.pdf
based off the above paper. uses ABC based somewhat on simulated annealing to infer a distribution over parameters for the start of the contagion. found in misinfo_abc.py. 
a more commented copy of the same code is found in bayesian_things.ipynb along with some plots of the parameter distributions
## utilities etc
misinfo_functions.py contains functions for computing relevant quantities and simulations
utilities.py contains utility functions for log computation etc
agents.py instantiates the agent classes, which are hopefully flexible enough for our purposes.
